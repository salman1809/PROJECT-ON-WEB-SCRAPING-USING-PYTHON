# PROJECT-ON-WEB-SCRAPING-USING-PYTHON
## This project focuses on extracting meaningful data from websites through web scraping techniques using Python. The objective is to collect raw data from different web pages, clean it, and transform it into a structured format for analysis. Python libraries such as Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas are used to fetch HTML content, parse the data, and store it in formats like CSV or Excel. Through this project, we can automate data collection from multiple sources such as e-commerce sites, news portals, or sports statistics pages. The outcome helps in building datasets that can be further used for insights, machine learning models, or decision-making processes. This project demonstrates practical skills in data extraction, preprocessing, and automation using Python.
